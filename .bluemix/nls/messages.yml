template.name: "CI - Develop a secure app with DevSecOps practices"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop an application utilizing DevSecOps best practices and test it on a Kubernetes cluster managed by the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n\nThe toolchain enables continuous delivery with Source Control, Delivery Pipelines for pull requests, and continuous integration. The delivery pipeline follows a shift-left approach and performs static code scans on source repositories, runs unit tests, builds docker image, scans application docker image for vulnerabilities, and applies a signature to the built image.\n\nThe toolchain collects pipeline run data at every stage as evidence for auditing purposes and stores it in the immutable form in IBM Cloud Object Storage. It enables the development team to record every successful application build as artifacts stored in the inventory repository.\n\nThe DevOps-Insights integration in the toolchain enables analysis of historical build data, trends, and detection anomalies.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the tutorial."
