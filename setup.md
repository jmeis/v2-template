# Setup Guide for Tekton CI Pipeline with Compliance

### 1. Create toolchain:

A toolchain can be created by
* **Create button** in the README

   [![Deploy To Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net/devops/graphics/create_toolchain_button.png)](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/compliance-ci-toolchain&env_id=ibm:yp:us-south)

* **the url**  
 <https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=&lt;template-repository-url&gt;&amp;env_id=ibm:yp:&lt;enviroment&gt;&amp;branch=&lt;branch&gt;>

Using the url, modifications on feature branches can be tried out before merging into master.

### 2. Name toolchain and select a toolchain region

| :--: | 

Review the default information for the toolchain settings. The toolchain's name identifies it in IBM Cloud. Make sure that the toolchain's name is unique within IBM Cloud. 

Note: toolchain region can differ from cluster and registry region.

### 3. Tool integrations

#### Repositories

### 4. Create Toolchain and add Delivery Pipeline Private Worker

 **Create toolchain:**

  - Click the create button at the bottom of the page, and wait for the toolchain to be created.
 
  Note: The individual toolchain integrations can be configured also after the pipeline has been created.

**Add Delivery Pipeline Private Worker**

You should add a private worker tool to the CI toolchain for a successful PR/CI run. Currently there are tasks in the tekton definitions what can have access for essential files for running by that way.

- Click the `Add a Tool+` button and select `Delivery Pipeline Private Worker`.

| ![Image](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/private-worker.png) |
| :--: | 

- Add the integration name.
- Click `Create +` button to create Service ID API Key.
- Click the `Create Integration` button.

| ![Image](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/delivery-pw.png) |
| :--: | 

- Now, your toolchain has got a Delivery Pipeline Private Worker. Click there and follow the instructions.
- Note: You must use IBM Cloud CLI for setup and configure. 
  
**dct init Pipeline**

The dct init pipeline is used during the image signing. It signs the current image in the CI/CD pipeline, what we want to install to the cluster. You need to run this pipeline only once:

- You only have to run the pipeline, because It is already configured.

### 5. Run PR/CI Pipeline

Configure your application repository via this [link](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/compliance-ci-toolchain/blob/master/docs/github-repository-configuration.md)
 
**Run PR Pipeline**

- To start the PR pipeline, you should create pull request in your application repository.
  
| ![Image](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/pr-checks.png) |
| :--: | 

- Several status checks will run on your branch, what you set in you branch protection rules e.g.(`whitewater-detect-secrets`, `tekton/pr-unit-tests`, `tekton/pr-compliance`)
  
**Run CI Pipeline**

There are two ways to start a CI pipeline:
1. After a successful PR pipeline, the pull request was approved and merged to the master.
2. Trigger the CI pipeline manually.

If you want to trigger the CI pipeline manually select the Delivery Pipeline card.

| ![Image](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/run-ci-pipeline.png) |
| :--: | 

Add it to the pipeline environmental variables (click `Configure Pipeline` button). 

 | ![Image](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/env-properties-ci.png) |
| :--: | 

You must add a `commit-id` text property (click `Add property` button and select `"Text property"`), if you trigger the pipeline manually.

For example: 
| ![Image](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/commit-id.png) |
| :--: | 

Add it to the trigger parameters (click `Run Pipeline` button), select `"Manual Trigger"` and click `Run`.
