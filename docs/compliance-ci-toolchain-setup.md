# Setup Guide for Tekton CI Pipeline with Compliance

### Prerequisites:
* **K8S Cluster**
* **Artifactory access**
* **IBM Cloud CLI**
* **[TaaS and CISO Registration](#taas-ciso-registration)**
* **IBM Cloud Api Key**
* [**Servide ID**](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-serviceids)
* [**Service ID API Key**](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-serviceidapikeys#create_service_key)
* [**HashiCorp Vault**](https://pages.github.ibm.com/vault-as-a-service/vault/)
* (optional) [COS Bucket configured as a Compliance Evidence Locker](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/cos-evidence-locker-buckets.md#bucket-configuration)


### <a id="taas-ciso-registration"></a>TaaS and CISO Registration
There are a couple of steps that need to be taken prior to creating this toolchain for the first time. 
1) Get access to a private worker that can establish a connection with the IBM internal network
2) A CISO account complete with a signing certificate

The CISO service is a signing service that can be leveraged for signing images. A worker with access to the internal IBM network is required to reach the CISO service. If you do not already has a private worker with IBM intenral network access, you can avail of the services provided by TaaS. With TaaS, you can generate a service_api_key, that will allow you access to a pool of workers that have been preconfigured with IBM network access. Visit the following links for more details.

* **[CISO Code Signing Service and Key Setup](<ciso-setup.md>)**

* **[Service API Key for TaaS Private Worker](<taas-setup.md>)**

Optionally, you can also follow the next two guides. These will help you set up cluster image enforcement with Portieris.
 
- ***Obtain the Public Key Certificate***

Create an instance of ***[this toolchain](<https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/portieris-config-helper>)***. Once this pipeline has run, you can retrieve the public certificate from the logs

- ***[Portieris Set Up](<portieris-setup.md>)***

The GitHub token that is issued to the IBM Cloud API key holder, needs access to read/set protected branch settings on repos.
This can be only done by admin level access to the repository.

- Possible solutions:
    - Use your personal IBM API key and personal repositories.
    - Use an IBM API key what is owned by a user with admin rights to the repository.  

### Migrating an existing DCT signing toolchain to CISO signing 
If you have an existing pipeline that uses DCT signing, the following link will show how to make the switch to CISO signing.
<https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/compliance-ci-toolchain/blob/master/docs/dct-ciso-migrate.md>

Otherwise continue with the setup doc to create a new toolchain.


### 1. Create toolchain:

A toolchain can be created by
* **Create button** in the README

   [![Deploy To Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net/devops/graphics/create_toolchain_button.png)](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/compliance-ci-toolchain&env_id=ibm:yp:us-south)

* **Using the URL and the branch parameter**:
 <https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/compliance-ci-toolchain&env_id=ibm:yp:us-south&branch=master>

Modifications on feature branches can be tried out before merging into master.

### 2. Name toolchain and select a toolchain region

| ![Toolchain default settings](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/toolchain-default-settings.png) |
| :--: | 

Review the default information for the toolchain settings. The toolchain's name identifies it in IBM Cloud. Make sure that the toolchain's name is unique within your toolchains for the same region and resource group in IBM Cloud.


Note: toolchain region can differ from cluster and registry region.

### 3. Tool integrations

#### HashiCorp Vault

Use HashiCorp Vault to securely store secrets that are needed by your toolchain. Examples of secrets are API keys, user passwords or any other tokens that enable access to sensitive information. Your toolchain stores references to the HashiCorp secrets, not the literal secret values, which enables advanced capabilities like secret rotation.

If your team does not have a HashiCorp Vault set up, you can follow [this documentation](https://pages.github.ibm.com/vault-as-a-service/vault/onboarding/project.html) to request a `Role ID`.

| ![HashiCorp Vault](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/hc-vault.png) |
| :--: |

 - **Name**: A name for this tool integration. This name will be displayed in the toolchain.
 - **Server URL**: The server URL for your HashiCorp Vault Instance. (`https://vserv-us.sos.ibm.com:8200`, `https://vserv-eu.sos.ibm.com:8200`, `https://vserv-test.sos.ibm.com:8200`)
 - **Integration URL**: The URL that you want to navigate to when you click the HashiCorp Vault Integration tile.
 - **Secrets Path**: The mount path where your secrets are stored in your HashiCorp Vault Instance.
 - **Authentication Method**: The Authentication method for your HashiCorp Vault Instance.
 - **Role ID:** Your team's [AppRole Role ID](https://pages.github.ibm.com/vault-as-a-service/vault/usage/approle-role-ids.html).
 - **Secret ID:** Your team's [Secret ID](https://pages.github.ibm.com/vault-as-a-service/vault/usage/manage-secret-ids.html).

Note: _We advise you to use AppRole authentication method as this method can be used to read secret values._

#### Key Protect

Use [Key Protect](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/key-protect) to securely store and apply secrets like API keys that are part of your toolchain. Literal secret values will be stored, rotation is not yet enabled.

| ![Key Protect](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/key-protect.png) |
| :--: |

A Key Protect tool integration is included in this template to securely manage the HashiCorp `Role ID` and `Secret ID` in accordance with the [best practices for vault](https://pages.github.ibm.com/vault-as-a-service/vault/usage/best-practices.html) recommended  by SOS. Ideally these two HashiCorp secrets should be stored in Key Protect as a prerequisite for users creating toolchains. Doing so will protect access to HashiCorp Vault, which is the default secrets repository for most consumers.

#### Repositories

| ![App repository](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/app-repo.png) |
| :--: | 

- **Application repository:** The application to be deployed. 

     All fields are required. 

    - **Repository type:**
      - `New`: Creates a new empty repository.
      - `Fork`: Fork the repository you add in the `Source repository URL` field.
      - `Clone`: Clone the repository you add in the `Source repository URL` field. You have to choose the owner of the repository, which by default is your selected IBM Cloud login account. Check the `Repository Name` field for possible mismatch.
      - `Existing:` It uses a repository what you source in the repository url.
    - **Source repository URL:**
        The application repository URL. 
      - Default: <https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/hello-compliance-app>

   - A new key can be created from here by clicking the `New +` button.
   - Generate a new api-key if you donâ€™t have one or copy an existing key to the field (IMPORTANT: if you want an IBM Cloud API key, you must have a Kubernetes cluster)

    
| ![New API Key](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/new-api-key.png) |
| :--: | 
    
   Note: The newly generated API key can be immediately saved to an existing Key Protect instance.
    
| ![Save new API Key](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/save-new-api-key.png) |
| :--: | 
    
   Note: A new Key Protect Instance can be created here: <https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/key-protect>  
   Note: An IBM Cloud API key can also be created here: <https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys>  
   
   Once the API Key field is filled out, the registry and cluster related fields will be filled out automatically.

| :--: | 
    
- **CISO secret:**
   - Use the picker to select the vault integration and key entry containing the CISO pfx certificate secret
    
    
##### Tekton Definitions

 Tekton definitions can be changed also after the toolchain is created. These repositories can be contributed to or can be forked.
 All fields are required.
 
   | ![Tekton definitions](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/tekton-definitions.png) |
   | :--: | 
 
 - **Tekton Definition repository:**
     The tekton pipeline defintions (pipeline(s), triggers, listeners, etc.) are kept in this repo.  
     Default: <https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/compliance-ci-toolchain>

 - **Tekton Catalog repository:**
     The common tekton tasks are contained in this repo.  
     Default: <https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/common-tekton-tasks> 
     
  | ![Tekton Definitions](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/tekton-definitions.png) |
  | :--: |

#### Delivery Pipeline Private Worker

This toolchain comes with a Private Worker integration.
The Delivery Pipeline Private Worker tool integration connects with one or more private workers that are capable of running Delivery Pipeline workloads in isolation.
Insert your `Service ID API Key` to the corresponding field. This should be the Service API key obtained from TaaS. It is required to connect to the IBM internal network.

| ![Delivery Pipeline Private Worker](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/private-worker-integration-setup.png) |
| :--: | 

For more information see:
 - [Working with Delivery Pipeline Private Workers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-private-workers)
 - [Service ID's](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/serviceids)

#### Cloud Object Storage (optional)

Cloud Object Storage is used to store the evidences and artifacts generated by the Compliance Pipelines.
If you wish to use this feature, you must have a Cloud Object Storage instance and a Bucket. [Read the recommendation for configuring a Bucket that can act as a Compliance Evidence Locker](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/cos-evidence-locker-buckets.md#bucket-configuration). 

_**NOTE:** this is currently optional, you can set any kind of COS bucket as a locker, event without a retention policy. The pipeline won't check or enforce settings at the moment._

For help, please visit the [Cloud Object Storage documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage).

You need to provide the following information for the Pipelines to reach the aforementioned bucket:
- Cloud Object Storage Endpoint
- Bucket Name

You can set up the COS locker later, by providing the necessari `cos-bucket-name` and `cos-endpoint`

To get the **Cloud Object Storage Endpoint**, please visit your COS Instance's page and select the _'Endpoints'_ section in the menu. You will need to copy the Public Endpoint matching the Bucket's _region_ and _resiliency_.

| ![COS Endpoint](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/cos-endpoint-menu.png) |
| :--: |

If You decide not to use Cloud Object Storage as an evidence locker, You can also set the required values after the creation of the toolchain by setting the `cos-bucket-name`, `cos-endpoint` environment variables in the CI Pipeline. 

#### Link DOI toolchain (optional)

CI toolchain needs a toolchain ID with an existing DevOps Insights instance, so that it is able to publish the deployment records to insights. If toolchain ID is not present, the local DevOps Insights integration is used if present.

| ![DOI Toolchain ID](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-cd-toolchain/doi-toolchain-optional.png) |
| :--: |

You can copy the Toolchain ID from the URL of your toolchain.
A toolchain's URL follows this pattern: `https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/toolchains/<toolchain-ID-comes-here>?env_id=ibm:yp:us-south`

For example, if the URL is: `https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/toolchains/aaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee?env_id=ibm:yp:us-south` then the toolchain's ID is: `aaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee`.

Note: Make sure to only include the ID here, not the full URL.


#### Artifactory

The template comes with an artifactory integration to enable using cocoa compliance custom base image in the tekton tasks.  
Note: You can access the Artifactory [here](https://eu.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory/webapp/#/home)  
      Further material and guides about the artifactory are available [here](https://taas.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/guides#artifactory)  

| ![Artifactory](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/artifactory.png) |
| :--: | 

- **Integration name:**  Tool integration name in the toolchain  
    Default: `artifactory-{timestamp}`
- **Integration URL:**  The url of the artifactory service   
    Default: `https://na.artifactory.swg-devops.com`  
    This is where the cocoa base image is stored.
- **Repository URL:**  The full url of the artifactory repository where images used in the compliance template are stored  
    Default: `https://wcp-compliance-automation-team-docker-local.artifactory.swg-devops.com`  
    This is where the cocoa base image is stored.
- **Repository name:**  The name of the artifactory repository
    Default: `wcp-compliance-automation-team-docker-local`  
    This is where the cocoa base image is stored.
- **Repository type:**  The artifactory repository type  
    Default: `Docker registry`  
    Note: This should not be changed, otherwise the pipeline will break.
- **User ID:** The artifactory user id - usually your w3 id
- **Authentication token:** The artifactory API key  
    An artifactory token can be created [here](https://eu.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory/webapp/#/profile) and stored in Key Protect  
    When an artifactory API key already exists in Key Protect, it can be imported here.

    Note: The User ID and the Authentication token is required for pipeline working!
- **Release URL:**  The url of the artifactory repository  
    Default: `wcp-compliance-automation-team-docker-local.artifactory.swg-devops.com`
    
#### DevOps Insights

| ![DevOps Insights](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/doi.png) |
| :--: | 

DevOps Insights is automatically included in the created toolchain and after each compliance check evidence is published into it. It is not needed to configure insights, the CI pipeline will automatically use the insights instance included in the toolchain.

#### Slack Integration (Not Required)

If you want to receive notifications about your PR/CI Pipeline events, you can configure the Slack Tool during the setup from the toolchain template, or you can add the Slack Tool later.

In order for a Slack channel to receive notifications from your tools, you need a Slack webhook URL. To get a webhook URL, see the Incoming Webhooks section of the [Slack API website](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

| ![Slack Tool](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/slack.png) |

### 4. Create Toolchain

 **Create toolchain:**

  - Click the create button at the bottom of the page, and wait for the toolchain to be created.

  Note: The individual toolchain integrations can be configured also after the pipeline has been created.


### 5. Run PR/CI Pipeline

Configure your application repository by following these [instructions](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/compliance-ci-toolchain/blob/master/docs/github-repository-configuration.md)
 
**Run PR Pipeline**

- To start the PR pipeline, you should create a pull request in your application repository.
  
| ![PR status checks](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/pr-checks.png) |
| :--: |

- Several status checks will run on your branch, which can be set in your branch protection rules

Currently


      tekton/code-branch-protection
      tekton/code-unit-tests
      tekton/code-cis-check
      tekton/code-vulnerability-scan
      tekton/code-detect-secrets


- Keep in mind, that at least one run is needed for github to list the status checks in Settings, to be able to mark them as required. Because of this, for the first time, pr pipeline will inevitably fail. Mark the status checks required and rerun the pr pipeline from the UI.
  
**Run CI Pipeline**

There are two ways to start a CI pipeline:
1. After a successful PR pipeline, approving and merging the PR to the master branch.
2. Trigger the CI pipeline manually.

If you want to trigger the CI pipeline manually select the Delivery Pipeline card.

| ![Run CI Pipeline](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/run-ci-pipeline.png) |
| :--: | 

**Configure Pipeline**

You can add a `commitid` text property (click `Add property` button and select `"Text property"`), if you trigger the pipeline manually. If no commit ID is supplied, the Pipeline will take the latest commit ID from the master branch of your app.

<!-- TBD: Readme needed after implementing the automated versioning -->

For example: 

| ![commit-id](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/commit-id.png) |
| :--: | 

Add the trigger parameters (click `Run Pipeline` button), select `"Manual Trigger"` and click `Run`.
