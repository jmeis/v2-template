# Setup Guide for Tekton CI Pipeline with Compliance

### Prerequisites:
* **K8S Cluster**
* **Artifactory access**
* **IBM Cloud CLI**
* **TaaS and Ciso Registrations**
* **IBM Cloud Api Key**
* [**Servide ID**](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-serviceids)
* [**Service ID API Key**](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-serviceidapikeys#create_service_key)

There are a couple of steps that need to be done prior to creating this toolchain for the first time.
Please see:

- ***CISO Code Signing Service and Key Setup*** <https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/compliance-ci-toolchain/blob/master/docs/ciso-setup.md>

- ***Service API Key for TaaS Private Worker*** <https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/compliance-ci-toolchain/blob/master/docs/taas-setup.md>

Optionally, you can also follow the next two guides. These will help you set up cluster image enforcement with Portieris.
 
- ***Obtain the Public Key Certificate*** Create and instance of the toolchain <https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/portieris-config-helper>. Once this pipeline has run, you can retrieve the public certificate from the logs

- ***Portieris Set Up*** <https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/compliance-ci-toolchain/blob/master/docs/portieris-setup.md>

The GitHub token that is issued to the IBM Cloud API key holder, needs access to read/set protected branch settings on repos.
This can be only done by admin level access to the repository.

- Possible solutions:
    - Use your personal IBM API key and personal repositories.
    - Use an IBM API key what is owned by a user with admin rights to the repository.  

### Migrating an existing DCT signing toolchain to CISO signing 
If you have an existing pipeline that uses DCT signing, the following link will show how to make the switch to CISO signing.
<https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/compliance-ci-toolchain/blob/master/docs/dct-ciso-migrate.md>

Otherwise continue with the setup doc to create a new toolchain.


### 1. Create toolchain:

A toolchain can be created by
* **Create button** in the README

   [![Deploy To Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net/devops/graphics/create_toolchain_button.png)](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/compliance-ci-toolchain&env_id=ibm:yp:us-south)

* **Using the URL and the branch parameter**:
 <https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/compliance-ci-toolchain&env_id=ibm:yp:us-south&branch=master>

Modifications on feature branches can be tried out before merging into master.

### 2. Name toolchain and select a toolchain region

| ![Toolchain default settings](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/toolchain-default-settings.png) |
| :--: | 

Review the default information for the toolchain settings. The toolchain's name identifies it in IBM Cloud. Make sure that the toolchain's name is unique within your toolchains for the same region and resource group in IBM Cloud.


Note: toolchain region can differ from cluster and registry region.

### 3. Tool integrations

#### Repositories

| ![App repository](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/app-repo.png) |
| :--: | 

- **Application repository:** The application to be deployed. 

     All fields are required. 

    - **Repository type:**
      - `New`: Creates a new empty repository.
      - `Fork`: Fork the repository you add in the `Source repository URL` field.
      - `Clone`: Clone the repository you add in the `Source repository URL` field. You have to choose the owner of the repository, which by default is your selected IBM Cloud login account. Check the `Repository Name` field for possible mismatch.
      - `Existing:` It uses a repository what you source in the repository url.
    - **Source repository URL:**
        The application repository URL. 
      - Default: <https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/hello-compliance-app>
    - **Owner:** The application repository owner. If you want to switch to a different account, click the Profile avatar icon in the banner and select the account.
      - Default: Your login account. 
    - **Repository Name:** The repository name will be generated from the name you gave for toolchain.
 
- **Application related repositories**

    All fields are required.

    - **Incident issues repository:** Issues about incidents that happen during the build and deployment process are stored here.    
        - Default repository type: `Clone`

    - **Evidence locker repository:** All raw compliance evidence that belongs to the application is collected here.  
        - Default repository type: `Clone` 
  
    - **Inventory repository:** Change management is tracked in this repository. CD pipeline creates a new branch named as the created CR number, and merges it to master after deployment is concluded.
        - Default repository type: `Clone` 

#### Delivery Pipeline
The Tekton CI Toolchain with Compliance comes with an integrated Tekton pipeline to automate continuous build, test and deploy of the Docker application.

| ![Delivery pipeline](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/delivery-pipeline.png) |
| :--: |

- **App name:**  
The name of the application.
    - Default: `hello-compliance-app`
    
- **IBM Cloud API Key:**  
The API key is used to interact with the ibmcloud CLI tool in several tasks.

    - An existing key can be copy&pasted
    - An existing key can be imported from an existing Key Protect Instance by clicking the key icon

#### Delivery Pipeline Private Worker

This toolchain comes with a Private Worker integration.
The Delivery Pipeline Private Worker tool integration connects with one or more private workers that are capable of running Delivery Pipeline workloads in isolation.
Insert your `Service ID API Key` to the corresponding field. This should be the Service API key obtained from TaaS. It is required to connect to the IBM internal network.

| ![Delivery Pipeline Private Worker](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/private-worker-integration-setup.png) |
| :--: | 

For more information see:
 - [Working with Delivery Pipeline Private Workers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-private-workers)
 - [Service ID's](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/serviceids)

#### Artifactory

The template comes with an artifactory integration to enable using cocoa compliance custom base image in the tekton tasks.  
Note: You can access the Artifactory [here](https://eu.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory/webapp/#/home)  
      Further material and guides about the artifactory are available [here](https://taas.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/guides#artifactory)  

| ![Artifactory](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/artifactory.png) |
| :--: | 

- **Integration name:**  Tool integration name in the toolchain  
    Default: `artifactory-{timestamp}`
- **Integration URL:**  The url of the artifactory service   
    Default: `https://na.artifactory.swg-devops.com`  
    This is where the cocoa base image is stored.
- **Repository URL:**  The full url of the artifactory repository where images used in the compliance template are stored  
    Default: `https://wcp-compliance-automation-team-docker-local.artifactory.swg-devops.com`  
    This is where the cocoa base image is stored.
- **Repository name:**  The name of the artifactory repository
    Default: `wcp-compliance-automation-team-docker-local`  
    This is where the cocoa base image is stored.
- **Repository type:**  The artifactory repository type  
    Default: `Docker registry`  
    Note: This should not be changed, otherwise the pipeline will break.
- **User ID:** The artifactory user id - usually your w3 id
- **Authentication token:** The artifactory API key  
    An artifactory token can be created [here](https://eu.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory/webapp/#/profile) and stored in Key Protect  
    When an artifactory API key already exists in Key Protect, it can be imported here.

    Note: The User ID and the Authentication token is required for pipeline working!
- **Release URL:**  The url of the artifactory repository  
    Default: `wcp-compliance-automation-team-docker-local.artifactory.swg-devops.com`
    
#### DevOps Insights

| ![DevOps Insights](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/doi.png) |
| :--: | 

DevOps Insights is automatically included in the created toolchain and after each compliance check evidence is published into it. It is not needed to configure insights, the CI pipeline will automatically use the insights instance included in the toolchain.

#### Slack Integration (Not Required)

If you want to receive notifications about your PR/CI Pipeline events, you can configure the Slack Tool during the setup from the toolchain template, or you can add the Slack Tool later.

In order for a Slack channel to receive notifications from your tools, you need a Slack webhook URL. To get a webhook URL, see the Incoming Webhooks section of the [Slack API website](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

| ![Slack Tool](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/slack.png) |
| :--: | 

After creating your toolchain, you can toggle sending notifications with the `slack-notifications` Environment Property in your PR/CI Pipeline (0 = off, 1 = on):

| ![Slack Tool Toggle](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/slack-toggle.png) |

### 4. Create Toolchain

 **Create toolchain:**

  - Click the create button at the bottom of the page, and wait for the toolchain to be created.

  Note: The individual toolchain integrations can be configured also after the pipeline has been created.


### 5. Run PR/CI Pipeline

Configure your application repository by following these [instructions](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/compliance-ci-toolchain/blob/master/docs/github-repository-configuration.md)
 
**Run PR Pipeline**

- To start the PR pipeline, you should create a pull request in your application repository.
  
| ![PR status checks](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/pr-checks.png) |
| :--: |

- Several status checks will run on your branch, which can be set in your branch protection rules

Currently


      tekton/code-branch-protection
      tekton/code-unit-tests
      tekton/code-cis-check
      tekton/code-vulnerability-scan
      tekton/code-detect-secrets


- Keep in mind, that at least one run is needed for github to list the status checks in Settings, to be able to mark them as required. Because of this, for the first time, pr pipeline will inevitably fail. Mark the status checks required and rerun the pr pipeline from the UI.
  
**Run CI Pipeline**

There are two ways to start a CI pipeline:
1. After a successful PR pipeline, approving and merging the PR to the master branch.
2. Trigger the CI pipeline manually.

If you want to trigger the CI pipeline manually select the Delivery Pipeline card.

| ![Run CI Pipeline](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/run-ci-pipeline.png) |
| :--: | 

**Configure Pipeline**

You must add a `commitid` text property (click `Add property` button and select `"Text property"`), if you trigger the pipeline manually.

<!-- TBD: Readme needed after implementing the automated versioning -->

For example: 

| ![commit-id](https://github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs/blob/master/assets/compliance-ci-toolchain/commit-id.png) |
| :--: | 

Add the trigger parameters (click `Run Pipeline` button), select `"Manual Trigger"` and click `Run`.
